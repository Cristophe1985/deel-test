# DEEL TEST for Creating Contracts #

*** IMPORTANT: Before you run these tests, is necesary to bypass login human check by deactivating CAPTCHA system. ***

This repo contains all stuff necesary to create Fixed rate, Milestone and Pay As You Go contracts with the required data.

In order to change contract data, you can edit 'CreatePage.createContract()' method in:

* test/specs/deel_test_contract_fixed_rate.js
* test/specs/deel_test_contract_milestone.js
* test/specs/deel_test_contract_pay_as_you_go.js

By setting parameters for:
- type
- name
- taxResidence
- taxResidenceProvince
- jobTitle
- seniorityLevel
- scopeWork
- currency
- paymentRate
- paymentFrequency
- milestoneName
- milestoneDescription
- milestoneAmount
- specialClause

Every single spec has his own suite, in order to execute them use:

* npx wdio wdio.conf.js --suite fixed_rate
* npx wdio wdio.conf.js --suite milestone
* npx wdio wdio.conf.js --suite pay_as_you_go

To execute them all at once (multi-threading) please use:

* npx wdio wdio.conf.js --suite fixed_rate --suite milestone --suite pay_as_you_go
